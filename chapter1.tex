\chapter{Introduction}

Policy change is a core interest in the social sciences. Although policy change is often the result of decisions made by institutional political actors, some policy issues are ``locked out'' of the traditional policy-making process. Marijuana legalization in the United States is an ideal case for identifying new mechanisms of policy change. 

One key to understanding when, how, and why policies change is through an examination of political, cultural, and structural contexts. Modeling the interrelation between political contexts and discourse, over time, while also accounting for the structural environments within which both are embedded is critical for understanding policy changes that are initiated by non-institutional actors. This dissertation aims to improve our understanding of policy change, generally, and the process of incremental marijuana legalization, more specifically. Across three empirical studies, this dissertation explores how narratives impact general discourse about marijuana, how discourse impacts the diffusion of legalization across states, and how segregation at the local level impacts support for legalization initiatives. I thus aim to address the evolution of marijuana politics over time, as well as extend theories of change on contentious political issues. 


Chapter 2 involves an exploration of marijuana discourse over time. Here, I model variation in narratives over time, and how these variations contribute to a dramatic drop in the amount of negative attention to/coverage of marijuana. 

Chapter 3 explains the rate of adoption/diffusion of legalization across the United States. I find that marijuana legalization was adopted more quickly in states with increasing amounts of positive discourse about marijuana. 

Chapter 4 investigates local level support for legalization initiatives. I argue that support is highest in communities with high levels of segregation between residents with children and those without. 


In sum, these chapters ask:

\begin{itemize}
\item Did discourse about marijuana change over time? If so, how and why?
\item What structural, political, or cultural factors impacted the rate of legalization?
\item What structural factors impacted support for legalization initiatives?
\end{itemize}

In all three studies, a blend of theoretical and methodological advancements will be applied for the purpose of improving models of policy change in the United States.
