  I would like to thank numerous individuals and organizations, without whom this dissertation would not have been possible. 
  
  I am grateful to my advisors and committee: Edwin Amenta, David Meyer, Rory McVeigh, and Charles Ragin for their mentorship, support, and sage advice on this and other projects over the years. 
  
   I would like to thank those shadow advisors who, oftentimes, aren't given the credit they deserve. It is for this reason I would like to thank Davin Phoenix -- without whom I would likely not have a job, and Christopher Parker, who has served nothing but realness and support during my graduate school career. As people of color, I am grateful for your support and mentorship. 
  
  
  %I am grateful to Edwin Amenta, whose advisement steered the direction of this work. I am also thankful for David Meyer, who, even before graduate school was willing to help me devise good research projects, while also caring about my wellbeing. Finally, I would like to thank Rory McVeigh, whose guidance, advice, mentorship, and work has heavily influenced this work. 
  
  I would like to thank faculty at the University of California, Irvine who have provided feedback and support along the way, including Evan Schofer, Nina Bandelj, Carter Butts, John Hipp, David Snow, Yang Su, Andrew Noymer, Sabrina Strings, Rocio Rosales, Jacob Avery, Katie Bolzendahl, and Katie Faust. In addition, I would like to thank the staff who've made my time at Irvine seamless, including John Sommerhauser, Ekua Arhin, Maryann Zovak-Wieder, and Hannah Absher.
  
  Of course, I cannot forget my UCI student life family. These people have been critical to my success and sanity during graduate school. I would like to thank Mart\'{i}n Jacinto, Miles Davison, Jess Lee, Sara Villalta, Claudia Campos, Alma Garza, Monique Kelly, Dana Moss, Thomas Elliott, Amber Tierney, Eulalie Laschever, Jonathan Lui, Kara Placek, Ksenia Gracheva, Ted Watson, John McCollum, Bonnie Bui, Jessica Kizer, Connor Strobel, Chris Gibson, Aaron Tester, Katt Hoban, Steph Jones, Mariam Ashtiani, Alice Motes, Dana Nakano, Hector Y. Martinez, Matt Rafalow, Nolan Phillips, Jayson Hunt, and Tyson Patros. In addition, I would like to thank those amazing friends in my cohort: Emma Smith, Sean Drake, Tanya Sanabria, Chris Zoeller, Zaib Tufail, and David Kong. Importantly, my life would have not been the same without the intellect, wit, skills, and connections with my good friends Rodolfo Lopez and Ben Gibson. I am truly grateful for their friendship. 
  
  In 2011, I was lucky enough to conduct research at the University of Notre Dame. During that Summer, and throughout the next year, I was able to develop strong relationships with many people. For their wisdom and friendship, I would like to thank Bryant Crubaugh, San Diego-native Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick, (brother) Jeffrey Seymour, David Everson, Marshall Taylor, Kevin Estep, Heather Price, Peter Barwis, Kristi Donaldson, Jonathan Schwarz, Nicole Perez, Ana Velitchkova, Ellen Childs, Josh Dinsman, Amy Jonason, Jade Avelis, Linda Kawentel, Megan Rogers, Megan Austin, and Matthew Chandler. Most importantly, I am so appreciative of my dude... my co-metalcorehead/co-insert-subgenre-here-head/$\emptyset$ fam, Justin Van Ness. Over the years, we've crashed on each other's couches, gone to shows, explored cities, eaten good food, suggested new bands, tried out new breweries, and rocked tf out together, while being professional by presenting our work at conferences, networking, and crankin' papes. Cheers to keeping it strong for many years to come.
  
I am grateful for my Ford Foundation family, which has been integral to my success. Without them, I would not be where I am today. A huge reason why I persisted in graduate school was because of these people. I am truly appreciative of these people of color. I would like to thank the people who stayed so close despite our distance: Victor Ray, Piko Ewoodzie, and Anthony Ocampo. These three have only been a text/phone call away. I am also grateful for so many others in my Ford family, including Vanessa D\'{i}az, Elliott Powell, Jonathan Rosa, Elizabeth Hinton, Yasmiyn Irizarry, Rashwan Ray, Abigail ``Aly'' Sewell, Augustin Diaz, Vlad Medenica, and Armand Gutierrez. 
  
 I would like to give a shout out to all the musicians and artists whose work kept me motivated to complete this work. Most of all, Architects, which has consistently provided heavy, politically-motivated music throughout my graduate career. I am also thankful for music created by letlive., Bring Me the Horizon (2004-2013), The Devil Wears Prada (2005-2010), Drop Dead Gorgeous, Dance Gavin Dance, Chelsea Grin (2018), Kendrick Lamar, Saosin, Lions Lions, Wind in Sails, Vanna (2004-2010), Jamie's Elsewhere, Pierce the Veil, Before Today, and Four Year Strong. 
  
 % My Family:
   I would also like to thank those people who have shaped me into the person I am, but may not recognize their impact. First, I would like to thank my closest friends from when I was a music major during my undergraduate career, including Loren Gamarra and John Urban. It was difficult to transition out of music, but I think I made a good choice. In addition, I would like to thank my brothers Joe Salcido, Reginald Webber Jr., Javier, Mike Ouellet, Kirshon Asborno, Jesse Glick, Matt McDavid, Chris Benzen, Jon Keith, Ib Salleh, Ish Salleh, other brothers Owen Griffin, Chad Morris, and Jon Locke, and (of course) my littles -- Alison Bellman and Derek Dobbs. 
   
   I chose to move on from a degree in music to a degree in sociology, in part, because of the inequality experiences shared by my fellow musician friends. I would like to thank Sean Murillo, John Whitt Jr., and all those others from the Tulare Western High School Drumline, and Band \& Colorguard.  %I am also thankful for those who helped me sustain my passion in music, including Raymond Ferenci, Matt Boyett, Darren Suey, Yolanda Flores, Nick Perry, Chris Ramos, Brian Frasquillo, Johanna Ilano, Jonathan Victorino, Richard Vowell, and Darcy XXX and many others from Tulare Western High School who shaped me. 
   I would like to also thank Michaela and Talina, and all the members of the innercircle: David Scott (TEDS), Brandon Lee Taylor (RANDO), and Jordan Aguirre (NADROJ). To you all, I say: LPCG. 
   
  
  I would also like to thank the Ford Foundation for funding earlier versions of this project through the Predoctoral Fellowship and the Dissertation Fellowship.

{
  %In the absence of comprehensive drug policy reform or political advocates, states and counties have become venues for policy change. 
  This dissertation investigates the causes of support for marijuana legalization across the United States. Across three empirical studies, I argue that increased support for and passage of legalization resulted from 1) increased attention to marijuana, and shifting frames associated with marijuana combined with 2) structural and political conditions that allowed for the resonance of claims about the benefits of marijuana legalization. The first study explores the dramatic shift in coverage of marijuana from 1990 to 2016. I show that media coverage of marijuana shifted from from dominant negative narratives of criminality and delinquency to more neutral coverage, focusing on revenue creation and linking marijuana to political behavior. The second study links discursive data to public opinion, structural, and political environment data to show that the shift towards positive discourse about marijuana was significantly associated with a quicker pace of legalization across the United States. In the final study, an analysis of marijuana legalization ballot initiatives, I find that counties with high levels of parental segregation have higher levels of support for legalization. This dissertation reveals a less understood mechanism of the policymaking process: when political advocates are lacking, the strategic use of media can transform meanings associated with contentious issues and garner public support.
